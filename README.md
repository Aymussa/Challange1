# Challange1
week 1 challange 
Optimise the code by elimnating the code that are not neccessary written effectly 

This is challange, i was given a task to optimise code on this website, where the code has a lot of divs and the CSS code was classed indivitally.

This task was to understand that the code can be better written to suit multiple action at onces rather than coding for indivaully class or and div. 

learning that the code can be done more effiently made me better understand understand the codes better, thus making me find better ways to rewrite the code more effectivly

There is still more code that i have learned to make effective but this show that i have ways to grow.


This project does not required to be installed, it can be copied and rewritten better
